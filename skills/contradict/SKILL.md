# Skill: /contradict [argument]

Delegate to Qwen via the stepped execution protocol. Claude orchestrates; Qwen executes.

## Steps

1. Parse Shane's request and extract the argument/topic (if provided)
2. Call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (standalone) or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (plugin — use whichever is available) with:
   - `task`: "Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md). Find logical tensions, contradictions, or inconsistencies in the vault related to '[argument]' (or across the full vault). Where does Shane contradict himself or hold competing beliefs?"
   - `skill`: "contradict"
   - `context`: any relevant context from the current conversation
3. Loop: if `status` is `"running"`, call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` (or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` in plugin) with `session_id`; repeat until `status` is `"done"` or `"error"`
4. Review Qwen's `result`, synthesize if needed, and present to Shane

## Task description for Qwen

Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md).

Find logical tensions, contradictions, or inconsistencies in the vault related to '[argument]' (or across the full vault). Where does Shane contradict himself or hold competing beliefs?

## Fallback (if qwen_start/qwen_continue unavailable)

Execute the skill directly:

1. Run `obsidian search query='[argument]' limit=15` via bash; if no argument, run broad searches via bash: `obsidian search query='believe' limit=10`, `obsidian search query='value' limit=10`, `obsidian search query='decided' limit=10`
2. Read 10–15 notes by running `obsidian read file='[note name]'` via bash for each, prioritizing notes that state positions or make claims
3. Look for contradictions:
   - Direct contradictions: two notes asserting opposite things about the same topic
   - Contextual contradictions: a stated belief that conflicts with a stated decision or habit
   - Temporal contradictions: a position that changed without acknowledgment
   - Value contradictions: two stated values that pull in opposite directions
4. For each contradiction found, present it as: "In [note A], you say [X]. In [note B], you say [Y]. These are in tension because [reason]."
5. Distinguish between healthy tension (holding complexity) and actual inconsistency (one must be wrong)
6. Present 3–5 most significant contradictions to Shane, with note references
