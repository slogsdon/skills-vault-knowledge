# Skill: /weekly-learnings [argument]

Synthesize the week's vault additions into a written reflection — key learnings, recurring themes, and open questions — as prose, not a bullet dump of activities.

**Don't:** use this for accountability analysis — that's /weekly-signals. Don't produce a bullet dump — synthesize into actual insights.

## Steps

1. Parse the argument/topic from Shane's request.
2. Follow [Qwen Protocol](_lib/qwen-protocol.md) with:
   - `task`: "Synthesize this week's vault additions and highlights into a meaningful weekly reflection or email update. What were the key learnings, themes, and open questions?"
   - `skill`: "weekly-learnings"
3. Review Qwen's result, synthesize if needed, and present to Shane.

## Fallback

If Qwen is unavailable:

1. Determine the current week's date range (Monday–Sunday, YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Read this week's daily notes by running `obsidian read file='Daily Notes/[date]'` via bash for each date in the week
3. Run `obsidian search query='[key theme or topic from the week]' limit=15` via bash to surface active notes from this week
4. Read the most active notes from this week
5. Synthesize into a weekly reflection with these sections:
   - **Key learnings** (3–5 concrete insights, not summaries of activity)
   - **Recurring themes** (what kept coming up across different contexts?)
   - **Open questions** (what is still unresolved or needs more thinking?)
   - **What surprised me** (anything that shifted existing assumptions?)
6. If `[argument]` was provided, scope the reflection to that topic
7. Present the reflection to Shane — format as a written piece, not a bullet dump
