# Skill: /challenge [argument]

Delegate to Qwen via the stepped execution protocol. Claude orchestrates; Qwen executes.

## Steps

1. Parse Shane's request and extract the argument/topic (if provided)
2. Call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (standalone) or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (plugin — use whichever is available) with:
   - `task`: "Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md). Steelman the strongest opposition to '[argument]'. Identify the most vulnerable assumptions, surface counterevidence from the vault, and pressure-test the position rigorously."
   - `skill`: "challenge"
   - `context`: any relevant context from the current conversation
3. Loop: if `status` is `"running"`, call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` (or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` in plugin) with `session_id`; repeat until `status` is `"done"` or `"error"`
4. Review Qwen's `result`, synthesize if needed, and present to Shane

## Task description for Qwen

Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md).

Steelman the strongest opposition to '[argument]'. Identify the most vulnerable assumptions, surface counterevidence from the vault, and pressure-test the position rigorously.

## Fallback (if qwen_start/qwen_continue unavailable)

Execute the skill directly:

1. Run `obsidian search query='[argument]' limit=10` via bash to find notes related to the topic
2. Read the relevant notes by running `obsidian read file='[note name]'` via bash for each — look especially for where Shane states the position most confidently
3. Steelman the opposition:
   - Build the strongest possible case against `[argument]` — not a strawman, the actual best version
   - Find the most vulnerable assumptions underlying `[argument]`; name them explicitly
   - Search the vault for any counterevidence — places where Shane's own notes undermine the position
4. Pressure-test the position:
   - What would have to be true for `[argument]` to be wrong?
   - What's the most common smart objection to this position?
   - What would a rigorous critic say?
5. Don't soften it — the value is in the discomfort
6. Present the challenge to Shane as: the strongest opposition case, the most vulnerable assumptions, and the counterevidence found in his own vault
