# Skill: /trace [argument]

Delegate to Qwen via the stepped execution protocol. Claude orchestrates; Qwen executes.

## Steps

1. Parse Shane's request and extract the argument/topic (if provided)
2. Call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (standalone) or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (plugin — use whichever is available) with:
   - `task`: "Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md). Map the chronological evolution of Shane's thinking about '[argument]' in the vault. Show how the idea developed, shifted, or matured over time."
   - `skill`: "trace"
   - `context`: any relevant context from the current conversation
3. Loop: if `status` is `"running"`, call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` (or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` in plugin) with `session_id`; repeat until `status` is `"done"` or `"error"`
4. Review Qwen's `result`, synthesize if needed, and present to Shane
5. Ask Shane: "Save this as a Concept page? (yes/no)"
   - If no: done.
   - If yes: ask "What's your take on this?" and wait for Shane's verbatim response
   - Create the Concept page:
     ```
     obsidian create name='Concepts/[topic]' content='## Shane'\''s Take\n\n[Shane'\''s words]\n\n## Summary / Key Points / Cross-references\n\n[synthesis output]' silent
     ```
   - Commit:
     ```bash
     VAULT="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Personal"
     git -C "$VAULT" add -A && git -C "$VAULT" commit -m "docs: add Concept page for [topic]"
     ```

## Task description for Qwen

Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md).

Map the chronological evolution of Shane's thinking about '[argument]' in the vault. How did the idea develop, shift, or mature over time?

## Fallback (if qwen_start/qwen_continue unavailable)

Execute the skill directly:

1. Run `obsidian search query='[argument]' limit=10` via bash to find notes related to the topic
2. Read the relevant notes by running `obsidian read file='[note name]'` via bash for each, paying attention to note dates and timestamps
3. Sort the notes chronologically by creation/modification date
4. Identify the evolution of thinking:
   - What was the earliest framing of the idea?
   - What shifted, and what triggered each shift?
   - What's the current settled position (if any), or what remains unresolved?
5. Present a chronological narrative showing how the idea developed, with specific note references and dates
6. Highlight inflection points — moments where the thinking meaningfully changed direction
7. Ask Shane: "Save this as a Concept page? (yes/no)"
   - If no: done.
   - If yes: ask "What's your take on this?" and wait for Shane's verbatim response
   - Create the Concept page:
     ```
     obsidian create name='Concepts/[topic]' content='## Shane'\''s Take\n\n[Shane'\''s words]\n\n## Summary / Key Points / Cross-references\n\n[synthesis output]' silent
     ```
   - Commit:
     ```bash
     VAULT="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Personal"
     git -C "$VAULT" add -A && git -C "$VAULT" commit -m "docs: add Concept page for [topic]"
     ```
