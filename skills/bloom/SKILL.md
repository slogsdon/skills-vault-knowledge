# Skill: /bloom [argument]

Delegate to Qwen via the stepped execution protocol. Claude orchestrates; Qwen executes.

## Steps

1. Parse Shane's request and extract the argument/topic (if provided)
2. Call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (standalone) or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (plugin — use whichever is available) with:
   - `task`: "Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md), `obsidian append file='Note Name' content='TEXT'`. Map how the question '[argument]' branches into sub-questions across the vault. What related questions does it open up? Create a bloom of inquiry."
   - `skill`: "bloom"
   - `context`: any relevant context from the current conversation
3. Loop: if `status` is `"running"`, call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` (or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` in plugin) with `session_id`; repeat until `status` is `"done"` or `"error"`
4. Review Qwen's `result`, synthesize if needed, and present to Shane

## Task description for Qwen

Vault access (bash only, no MCP tools): `obsidian search query='TERM' limit=10`, `obsidian read file='Note Name'` (no .md).

Map how the question '[argument]' branches into sub-questions across the vault. What related questions does it open up? Create a bloom of inquiry.

## Fallback (if qwen_start/qwen_continue unavailable)

Execute the skill directly:

1. Run `obsidian search query='[argument]' limit=10` via bash to find notes touching on the topic
2. Read the most relevant notes by running `obsidian read file='[note name]'` via bash for each
3. Generate a bloom of inquiry — map the question space branching from `[argument]`:
   - **Level 1 (direct sub-questions):** What are the immediate follow-on questions this topic raises?
   - **Level 2 (adjacent questions):** What related topics does this connect to? What domains share the same underlying structure?
   - **Level 3 (meta questions):** What assumptions are baked into how `[argument]` is framed? What would a fundamentally different framing look like?
4. Note which branches are already explored in the vault vs. which are blank
5. Present the bloom as a structured map — not a flat list, but a tree showing how questions relate and nest
6. Suggest 1–2 unexplored branches most worth pursuing
